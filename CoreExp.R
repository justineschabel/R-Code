#Two core in a CPU serve jobs from a single queue.
# The time it takes one core to serve a randomly selected job is distributed as 1/5
#so that his average service time is 5 minutes. The other, more powerful coreâ€™s service times are distributed as
# 1/4, averaging 4 minutes. Cores work independently. Both cores are busy and a new job arrives in the queue.
